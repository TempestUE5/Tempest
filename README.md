Tempest is a game developed by Daniel Gerhardt and Amy Liu. It was created in UE5 and utilized the GameplayAbilitySystem for the player and enemies. 

The game is an arena brawler. The player faces repeated waves of enemies and is tasked with beating the enemies and surviving.

The player has a basic sword attack, executed with left click, which requires no resources. They also have abilities that take mana. Mana is restored by standing in water regions of the map. The regions will be used up by standing on them for ten seconds, and return fifteen seconds after being used up. Abilities are indicated in the bottom left with their key, and on use will show if they have a cooldown. The water gun ability is also a held ability that requires holding the key for proper use.
